Return True if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.\n\nThe board is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters &quot; &quot;, &quot;X&quot;, and &quot;O&quot;.&#xA0; The &quot; &quot; character represents an empty square.\n\nHere are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:\n\n\n\tPlayers take turns placing characters into empty squares (&quot; &quot;).\n\tThe first player always places &quot;X&quot; characters, while the second player always places &quot;O&quot; characters.\n\t&quot;X&quot; and &quot;O&quot; characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.\n\tThe game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.\n\tThe game also ends if all squares are non-empty.\n\tNo more moves can be played if the game is over.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: board = [&quot;O&#xA0; &quot;, &quot;&#xA0; &#xA0;&quot;, &quot;&#xA0; &#xA0;&quot;]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: The first player always plays &quot;X&quot;.\n\nExample 2:\nInput: board = [&quot;XOX&quot;, &quot; X &quot;, &quot;   &quot;]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Players take turns making moves.\n\nExample 3:\nInput: board = [&quot;XXX&quot;, &quot;   &quot;, &quot;OOO&quot;]\nOutput: false\n\nExample 4:\nInput: board = [&quot;XOX&quot;, &quot;O O&quot;, &quot;XOX&quot;]\nOutput: true\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tboard is a length-3 array of strings, where each string board[i] has length 3.\n\tEach board[i][j] is a character in the set {&quot; &quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;O&quot;}.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool ValidTicTacToe(string[] board) {            }}"}
