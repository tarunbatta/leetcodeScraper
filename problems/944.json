{"number":"944","title":"Delete Columns to Make Sorted","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted","difficulty":"Easy","question":"We are given an array&#xA0;A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same length.\n\nNow, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.\n\nFor example, if we have an array A = [&quot;abcdef&quot;,&quot;uvwxyz&quot;] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is [&quot;bef&quot;, &quot;vyz&quot;],&#xA0;and the remaining columns of A are&#xA0;[&quot;b&quot;,&quot;v&quot;], [&quot;e&quot;,&quot;y&quot;], and [&quot;f&quot;,&quot;z&quot;].&#xA0; (Formally, the c-th column is [A[0][c], A[1][c], ..., A[A.length-1][c]].)\n\nSuppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, each remaining column in A is in non-decreasing sorted order.\n\nReturn the minimum possible value of D.length.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [&quot;cba&quot;,&quot;daf&quot;,&quot;ghi&quot;]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nAfter choosing D = {1}, each column [&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;g&quot;] and [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;f&quot;,&quot;i&quot;] are in non-decreasing sorted order.\nIf we chose D = {}, then a column [&quot;b&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;h&quot;] would not be in non-decreasing sorted order.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: D = {}\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [&quot;zyx&quot;,&quot;wvu&quot;,&quot;tsr&quot;]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: D = {0, 1, 2}\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 100\n\t1 &lt;= A[i].length &lt;= 1000\n\n\n\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MinDeletionSize(string[] A) {            }}"}
