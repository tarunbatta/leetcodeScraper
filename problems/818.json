{"number":"818","title":"Race Car","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/race-car","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line.&#xA0; (Your car can go into negative positions.)\n\nYour car drives automatically according to a sequence of instructions A (accelerate) and R (reverse).\n\nWhen you get an instruction &quot;A&quot;, your car does the following:&#xA0;position += speed, speed *= 2.\n\nWhen you get an instruction &quot;R&quot;, your car does the following: if your speed is positive then&#xA0;speed = -1&#xA0;, otherwise&#xA0;speed = 1.&#xA0; (Your position stays the same.)\n\nFor example, after commands &quot;AAR&quot;, your car goes to positions 0-&gt;1-&gt;3-&gt;3, and your speed goes to 1-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;-1.\n\nNow for some target position, say the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \ntarget = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nThe shortest instruction sequence is &quot;AA&quot;.\nYour position goes from 0-&gt;1-&gt;3.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \ntarget = 6\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: \nThe shortest instruction sequence is &quot;AAARA&quot;.\nYour position goes from 0-&gt;1-&gt;3-&gt;7-&gt;7-&gt;6.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote: \n\n\n\t1 &lt;= target &lt;= 10000.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int Racecar(int target) {            }}"}
