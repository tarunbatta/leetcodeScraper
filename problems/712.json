{"number":"712","title":"Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given two strings s1, s2, find the lowest ASCII sum of deleted characters to make two strings equal.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: s1 = &quot;sea&quot;, s2 = &quot;eat&quot;\nOutput: 231\nExplanation: Deleting &quot;s&quot; from &quot;sea&quot; adds the ASCII value of &quot;s&quot; (115) to the sum.\nDeleting &quot;t&quot; from &quot;eat&quot; adds 116 to the sum.\nAt the end, both strings are equal, and 115 + 116 = 231 is the minimum sum possible to achieve this.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: s1 = &quot;delete&quot;, s2 = &quot;leet&quot;\nOutput: 403\nExplanation: Deleting &quot;dee&quot; from &quot;delete&quot; to turn the string into &quot;let&quot;,\nadds 100[d]+101[e]+101[e] to the sum.  Deleting &quot;e&quot; from &quot;leet&quot; adds 101[e] to the sum.\nAt the end, both strings are equal to &quot;let&quot;, and the answer is 100+101+101+101 = 403.\nIf instead we turned both strings into &quot;lee&quot; or &quot;eet&quot;, we would get answers of 433 or 417, which are higher.\n\n\n\nNote:\n0 &lt; s1.length, s2.length &lt;= 1000.\nAll elements of each string will have an ASCII value in [97, 122]. \n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MinimumDeleteSum(string s1, string s2) {            }}"}
