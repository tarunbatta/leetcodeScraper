{"number":"1024","title":"Video Stitching","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/video-stitching","difficulty":"Medium","question":"You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted T seconds.&#xA0;&#xA0;These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varied lengths.\n\nEach video clip clips[i]&#xA0;is an interval: it starts at time clips[i][0] and ends at time clips[i][1].&#xA0; We can cut these clips into segments freely: for example, a clip [0, 7] can be cut into segments&#xA0;[0, 1] +&#xA0;[1, 3] + [3, 7].\n\nReturn the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event ([0, T]).&#xA0; If the task is impossible, return -1.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nWe take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.\nThen, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:\nWe cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].\nNow we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], T = 5\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: \nWe can&apos;t cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [0,2].\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], T = 9\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nWe can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: clips = [[0,4],[2,8]], T = 5\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nNotice you can have extra video after the event ends.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= clips.length &lt;= 100\n\t0 &lt;= clips[i][0], clips[i][1] &lt;= 100\n\t0 &lt;= T &lt;= 100\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int VideoStitching(int[][] clips, int T) {            }}"}
