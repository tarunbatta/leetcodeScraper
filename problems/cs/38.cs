38. Count and Say
Easy

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221


1 is read off as &quot;one 1&quot; or 11.
11 is read off as &quot;two 1s&quot; or 21.
21 is read off as &quot;one 2, then one 1&quot; or 1211.

Given an integer n&#xA0;where 1 &#x2264; n &#x2264; 30, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
