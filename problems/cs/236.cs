236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
Medium

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: &#x201C;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p&#xA0;and q&#xA0;as the lowest node in T that has both p&#xA0;and q&#xA0;as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).&#x201D;

Given the following binary tree:&#xA0; root =&#xA0;[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

&#xA0;

Example 1:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.


Example 2:

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.


&#xA0;

Note:


	All of the nodes&apos; values will be unique.
	p and q are different and both values will&#xA0;exist in the binary tree.
