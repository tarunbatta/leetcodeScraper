235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
Easy

Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: &#x201C;The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q&#xA0;as the lowest node in T that has both p and q&#xA0;as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).&#x201D;

Given binary search tree:&#xA0; root =&#xA0;[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

&#xA0;

Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.


Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.


&#xA0;

Note:


	All of the nodes&apos; values will be unique.
	p and q are different and both values will&#xA0;exist in the BST.
