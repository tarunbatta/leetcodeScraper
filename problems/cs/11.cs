11. Container With Most Water
Medium

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an&#xA0;, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note:&#xA0;You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

&#xA0;



The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain&#xA0;is 49. 

&#xA0;

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
