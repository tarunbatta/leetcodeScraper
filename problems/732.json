{"number":"732","title":"My Calendar III","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-iii","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Implement a MyCalendarThree class to store your events. A new event can always be added.\n\nYour class will have one method, book(int start, int end). Formally, this represents a booking on the half open interval [start, end), the range of real numbers x such that start &lt;= x &lt; end.\n\nA K-booking happens when K events have some non-empty intersection (ie., there is some time that is common to all K events.)\n\nFor each call to the method MyCalendar.book, return an integer K representing the largest integer such that there exists a K-booking in the calendar.\nYour class will be called like this: MyCalendarThree cal = new MyCalendarThree(); MyCalendarThree.book(start, end)\n\nExample 1:\n\nMyCalendarThree();\nMyCalendarThree.book(10, 20); // returns 1\nMyCalendarThree.book(50, 60); // returns 1\nMyCalendarThree.book(10, 40); // returns 2\nMyCalendarThree.book(5, 15); // returns 3\nMyCalendarThree.book(5, 10); // returns 3\nMyCalendarThree.book(25, 55); // returns 3\nExplanation: \nThe first two events can be booked and are disjoint, so the maximum K-booking is a 1-booking.\nThe third event [10, 40) intersects the first event, and the maximum K-booking is a 2-booking.\nThe remaining events cause the maximum K-booking to be only a 3-booking.\nNote that the last event locally causes a 2-booking, but the answer is still 3 because\neg. [10, 20), [10, 40), and [5, 15) are still triple booked.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe number of calls to MyCalendarThree.book per test case will be at most 400.\n\tIn calls to MyCalendarThree.book(start, end), start and end are integers in the range [0, 10^9].\n\n\n&#xA0;","code":"undefinedpublic class MyCalendarThree {​    public MyCalendarThree() {            }        public int Book(int start, int end) {            }}​/** * Your MyCalendarThree object will be instantiated and called as such: * MyCalendarThree obj = new MyCalendarThree(); * int param_1 = obj.Book(start,end); */"}
