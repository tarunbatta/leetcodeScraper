    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "In a 2 dimensional array grid, each value grid[i][j] represents the height of a building located there. We are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts&#xA0;can be different for different buildings). Height&#xA0;0 is considered to be a&#xA0;building&#xA0;as well.&#xA0;\n\nAt the end, the &quot;skyline&quot; when viewed from all four directions&#xA0;of the grid, i.e.&#xA0;top, bottom, left, and right,&#xA0;must be the same as the&#xA0;skyline of the original grid. A city&apos;s skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance. See&#xA0;the following example.\n\nWhat is the maximum total sum that the height of the buildings can be increased?\n\nExample:\nInput: grid = [[3,0,8,4],[2,4,5,7],[9,2,6,3],[0,3,1,0]]\nOutput: 35\nExplanation: \nThe grid is:\n[ [3, 0, 8, 4], \n  [2, 4, 5, 7],\n  [9, 2, 6, 3],\n  [0, 3, 1, 0] ]\n\nThe skyline viewed from top or bottom is: [9, 4, 8, 7]\nThe skyline viewed from left or right is: [8, 7, 9, 3]\n\nThe grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines is:\n\ngridNew = [ [8, 4, 8, 7],\n            [7, 4, 7, 7],\n            [9, 4, 8, 7],\n            [3, 3, 3, 3] ]\n\n\n\nNotes: \n\n\n\t1 &lt; grid.length = grid[0].length &lt;= 50.\n\tAll heights grid[i][j] are in the range [0, 100].\n\tAll buildings in grid[i][j] occupy the entire grid cell: that is, they are a 1 x 1 x grid[i][j] rectangular prism.\n\n",
