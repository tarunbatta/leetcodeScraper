{"number":"775","title":"Global and Local Inversions","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/global-and-local-inversions","difficulty":"Medium","question":"We have some permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N - 1], where N is the length of A.\n\nThe number of (global) inversions is the number of i &lt; j with 0 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt; N and A[i] &gt; A[j].\n\nThe number of local inversions is the number of i with 0 &lt;= i &lt; N and A[i] &gt; A[i+1].\n\nReturn true&#xA0;if and only if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: A = [1,0,2]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: There is 1 global inversion, and 1 local inversion.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: A = [1,2,0]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: There are 2 global inversions, and 1 local inversion.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tA will be a permutation of [0, 1, ..., A.length - 1].\n\tA will have length in range [1, 5000].\n\tThe time limit for this problem has been reduced.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool IsIdealPermutation(int[] A) {            }}"}
