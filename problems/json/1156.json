    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "Given a string text, we are allowed to swap two of the characters in the string. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters.\n\n&#xA0;\nExample 1:\n\nInput: text = &quot;ababa&quot;\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: We can swap the first &apos;b&apos; with the last &apos;a&apos;, or the last &apos;b&apos; with the first &apos;a&apos;. Then, the longest repeated character substring is &quot;aaa&quot;, which its length is 3.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: text = &quot;aaabaaa&quot;\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: Swap &apos;b&apos; with the last &apos;a&apos; (or the first &apos;a&apos;), and we get longest repeated character substring &quot;aaaaaa&quot;, which its length is 6.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: text = &quot;aaabbaaa&quot;\nOutput: 4\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: text = &quot;aaaaa&quot;\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: No need to swap, longest repeated character substring is &quot;aaaaa&quot;, length is 5.\n\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: text = &quot;abcdef&quot;\nOutput: 1\n\n\n&#xA0;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= text.length &lt;= 20000\n\ttext consist of lowercase English characters only.\n",
