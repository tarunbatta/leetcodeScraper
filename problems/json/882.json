{"number":"882","title":"Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/reachable-nodes-in-subdivided-graph","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Starting with an&#xA0;undirected graph (the &quot;original graph&quot;) with nodes from 0 to N-1, subdivisions are made to some of the edges.\n\nThe graph is given as follows: edges[k] is a list of integer pairs (i, j, n) such that (i, j) is an edge of the original graph,\n\nand n is the total number of new nodes on that edge.&#xA0;\n\nThen, the edge (i, j) is deleted from the original graph,&#xA0;n&#xA0;new nodes (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) are added to the original graph,\n\nand n+1 new&#xA0;edges (i, x_1), (x_1, x_2), (x_2, x_3), ..., (x_{n-1}, x_n), (x_n, j)&#xA0;are added to the original&#xA0;graph.\n\nNow, you start at node 0&#xA0;from the original graph, and in each move, you travel along one&#xA0;edge.&#xA0;\n\nReturn how many nodes you can reach in at most M moves.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: edges = [[0,1,10],[0,2,1],[1,2,2]], M = 6, N = 3\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: \nThe nodes that are reachable in the final graph after M = 6 moves are indicated below.\n\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: edges = [[0,1,4],[1,2,6],[0,2,8],[1,3,1]], M = 10, N = 4\nOutput: 23\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t0 &lt;= edges.length &lt;= 10000\n\t0 &lt;= edges[i][0] &lt;&#xA0;edges[i][1] &lt; N\n\tThere does not exist any&#xA0;i != j for which edges[i][0] == edges[j][0] and edges[i][1] == edges[j][1].\n\tThe original graph&#xA0;has no parallel edges.\n\t0 &lt;= edges[i][2] &lt;= 10000\n\t0 &lt;= M &lt;= 10^9\n\t1 &lt;= N &lt;= 3000\n\tA reachable node is a node that can be travelled to&#xA0;using at most&#xA0;M moves starting from&#xA0;node 0.\n\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int ReachableNodes(int[][] edges, int M, int N) {            }}"}
