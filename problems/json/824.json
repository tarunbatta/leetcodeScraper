{"number":"824","title":"Goat Latin","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/goat-latin","difficulty":"Easy","question":"A sentence S is given, composed of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.\n\nWe would like to convert the sentence to &quot;Goat Latin&quot;&#xA0;(a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.)\n\nThe rules of Goat Latin are as follows:\n\n\n\tIf a word begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u), append &quot;ma&quot;&#xA0;to the end of the word.\n\tFor example, the word &apos;apple&apos; becomes &apos;applema&apos;.\n\t&#xA0;\n\tIf a word begins with a consonant (i.e. not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add &quot;ma&quot;.\n\tFor example, the word &quot;goat&quot;&#xA0;becomes &quot;oatgma&quot;.\n\t&#xA0;\n\tAdd one letter &apos;a&apos;&#xA0;to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with 1.\n\tFor example,&#xA0;the first word gets &quot;a&quot; added to the end, the second word gets &quot;aa&quot; added to the end and so on.\n\n\nReturn the&#xA0;final sentence representing the conversion from S&#xA0;to Goat&#xA0;Latin.&#xA0;\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: &quot;I speak Goat Latin&quot;\nOutput: &quot;Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa&quot;\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: &quot;The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog&quot;\nOutput: &quot;heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa&quot;\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\tS contains only uppercase, lowercase and spaces.&#xA0;Exactly one space between each word.\n\t1 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 150.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public string ToGoatLatin(string S) {            }}"}
