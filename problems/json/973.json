{"number":"973","title":"K Closest Points to Origin","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin","difficulty":"Medium","question":"We have a list of points&#xA0;on the plane.&#xA0; Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).\n\n(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)\n\nYou may return the answer in any order.&#xA0; The&#xA0;answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], K = 1\nOutput: [[-2,2]]\nExplanation: \nThe distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).\nThe distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).\nSince sqrt(8) &lt; sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.\nWe only want the closest K = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2,2]].\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], K = 2\nOutput: [[3,3],[-2,4]]\n(The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.)\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= K &lt;= points.length &lt;= 10000\n\t-10000 &lt; points[i][0] &lt; 10000\n\t-10000 &lt; points[i][1] &lt; 10000\n\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int[][] KClosest(int[][] points, int K) {            }}"}
