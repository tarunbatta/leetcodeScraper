    "question": "A transaction is possibly invalid if:\n\n\n\tthe amount exceeds $1000, or;\n\tif it occurs within (and including) 60 minutes of another transaction with the same name in a different city.\n\n\nEach transaction string transactions[i]&#xA0;consists of&#xA0;comma separated values representing&#xA0;the name, time (in minutes), amount, and city of the transaction.\n\nGiven a list of transactions,&#xA0;return a list of transactions that are possibly invalid.&#xA0; You may return the answer in any order.\n\n&#xA0;\nExample 1:\n\nInput: transactions = [&quot;alice,20,800,mtv&quot;,&quot;alice,50,100,beijing&quot;]\nOutput: [&quot;alice,20,800,mtv&quot;,&quot;alice,50,100,beijing&quot;]\nExplanation: The first transaction is invalid because the second transaction occurs within a difference of 60 minutes, have the same name and is in a different city. Similarly the second one is invalid too.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: transactions = [&quot;alice,20,800,mtv&quot;,&quot;alice,50,1200,mtv&quot;]\nOutput: [&quot;alice,50,1200,mtv&quot;]\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: transactions = [&quot;alice,20,800,mtv&quot;,&quot;bob,50,1200,mtv&quot;]\nOutput: [&quot;bob,50,1200,mtv&quot;]\n\n\n&#xA0;\nConstraints:\n\n\n\ttransactions.length &lt;= 1000\n\tEach transactions[i] takes the form &quot;{name},{time},{amount},{city}&quot;\n\tEach {name} and {city}&#xA0;consist of&#xA0;lowercase English letters, and have lengths between 1 and 10.\n\tEach {time} consist of&#xA0;digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 1000.\n\tEach {amount}&#xA0;consist of&#xA0;digits, and represent an integer between 0 and 2000.\n\n",
