{"number":"956","title":"Tallest Billboard","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/tallest-billboard","difficulty":"Hard","question":"You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height.&#xA0; The billboard will have two steel supports, one on each side.&#xA0; Each steel support must be an equal height.\n\nYou have a collection of rods which can be welded together.&#xA0; For example, if you have rods of lengths 1, 2, and 3, you can weld them together to make a support of length 6.\n\nReturn the largest possible height of your billboard installation.&#xA0; If you cannot support the billboard, return 0.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,2,3,6]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: We have two disjoint subsets {1,2,3} and {6}, which have the same sum = 6.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,2,3,4,5,6]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: We have two disjoint subsets {2,3,5} and {4,6}, which have the same sum = 10.\n\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [1,2]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The billboard cannot be supported, so we return 0.\n\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t0 &lt;= rods.length &lt;= 20\n\t1 &lt;= rods[i] &lt;= 1000\n\tThe sum of rods is at most 5000.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int TallestBillboard(int[] rods) {            }}"}
