{"number":"785","title":"Is Graph Bipartite?","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/is-graph-bipartite","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given an undirected&#xA0;graph, return true if and only if it is bipartite.\n\nRecall that a graph is bipartite if we can split it&apos;s set of nodes into two independent&#xA0;subsets A and B such that every edge in the graph has one node in A and another node in B.\n\nThe graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of indexes j for which the edge between nodes i and j exists.&#xA0; Each node is an integer between 0 and graph.length - 1.&#xA0; There are no self edges or parallel edges: graph[i] does not contain i, and it doesn&apos;t contain any element twice.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [0,2]]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThe graph looks like this:\n0----1\n|    |\n|    |\n3----2\nWe can divide the vertices into two groups: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [[1,2,3], [0,2], [0,1,3], [0,2]]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: \nThe graph looks like this:\n0----1\n| \\  |\n|  \\ |\n3----2\nWe cannot find a way to divide the set of nodes into two independent subsets.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tgraph will have length in range [1, 100].\n\tgraph[i] will contain integers in range [0, graph.length - 1].\n\tgraph[i] will not contain i or duplicate values.\n\tThe graph is undirected: if any element j is in graph[i], then i will be in graph[j].\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool IsBipartite(int[][] graph) {            }}"}
