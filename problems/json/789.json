    "question": "You are playing a simplified Pacman game. You&#xA0;start at the point (0, 0), and your destination is (target[0], target[1]). There are several ghosts on the map, the i-th ghost starts at (ghosts[i][0], ghosts[i][1]).\n\nEach turn, you and all ghosts simultaneously *may* move in one of 4 cardinal directions: north, east, west, or south, going from the previous point to a new point 1 unit of distance away.\n\nYou escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you (for any given moves the ghosts may take.)&#xA0; If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it doesn&apos;t count as an escape.\n\nReturn True if and only if it is possible to escape.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \nghosts = [[1, 0], [0, 3]]\ntarget = [0, 1]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nYou can directly reach the destination (0, 1) at time 1, while the ghosts located at (1, 0) or (0, 3) have no way to catch up with you.\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \nghosts = [[1, 0]]\ntarget = [2, 0]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: \nYou need to reach the destination (2, 0), but the ghost at (1, 0) lies between you and the destination.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: \nghosts = [[2, 0]]\ntarget = [1, 0]\nOutput: false\nExplanation: \nThe ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tAll points have coordinates with absolute value &lt;= 10000.\n\tThe number of ghosts will not exceed 100.\n\n",
