{"number":"763","title":"Partition Labels","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels","difficulty":"Medium","question":"\nA string S of lowercase letters is given.  We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: S = &quot;ababcbacadefegdehijhklij&quot;\nOutput: [9,7,8]\nExplanation:\nThe partition is &quot;ababcbaca&quot;, &quot;defegde&quot;, &quot;hijhklij&quot;.\nThis is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.\nA partition like &quot;ababcbacadefegde&quot;, &quot;hijhklij&quot; is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.\n\n\n\nNote:\nS will have length in range [1, 500].\nS will consist of lowercase letters (&apos;a&apos; to &apos;z&apos;) only.\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public IList<int> PartitionLabels(string S) {            }}"}
