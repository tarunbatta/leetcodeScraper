{"number":"740","title":"Delete and Earn","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-and-earn","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given an array nums of integers, you can perform operations on the array.\n\nIn each operation, you pick any nums[i] and delete it to earn nums[i] points. After, you must delete every element equal to nums[i] - 1 or nums[i] + 1.\n\nYou start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [3, 4, 2]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: \nDelete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.\nThen, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]\nOutput: 9\nExplanation: \nDelete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2&apos;s and the 4.\nThen, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.\n9 total points are earned.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe length of nums is at most 20000.\n\tEach element nums[i] is an integer in the range [1, 10000].\n\n\n&#xA0;\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int DeleteAndEarn(int[] nums) {            }}"}
