{"number":"757","title":"Set Intersection Size At Least Two","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/set-intersection-size-at-least-two","difficulty":"Hard","question":"\nAn integer interval [a, b] (for integers a &lt; b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.\n\nFind the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has size at least 2.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: intervals = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nConsider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.\nAlso, there isn&apos;t a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.\nThus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: intervals = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 5]]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nAn example of a minimum sized set is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.\n\n\n\nNote:\nintervals will have length in range [1, 3000].\nintervals[i] will have length 2, representing some integer interval.\nintervals[i][j] will be an integer in [0, 10^8].\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int IntersectionSizeTwo(int[][] intervals) {            }}"}
