    "question": "Given an array A&#xA0;of 0s and 1s, we may change up to K&#xA0;values from 0 to 1.\n\nReturn the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only 1s.&#xA0;\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: A = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], K = 2\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: \n[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]\nBolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: A = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], K = 3\nOutput: 10\nExplanation: \n[0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]\nBolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1.  The longest subarray is underlined.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 20000\n\t0 &lt;= K &lt;= A.length\n\tA[i] is 0 or 1&#xA0;\n\n\n\n",
