{"number":"756","title":"Pyramid Transition Matrix","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/pyramid-transition-matrix","difficulty":"Medium","question":"We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter string.\n\nWe are allowed to place any color block C on top of two adjacent blocks of colors A and B, if and only if ABC is an allowed triple.\n\nWe start with a bottom row of bottom, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples allowed. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length 3.\n\nReturn true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: bottom = &quot;BCD&quot;, allowed = [&quot;BCG&quot;, &quot;CDE&quot;, &quot;GEA&quot;, &quot;FFF&quot;]\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nWe can stack the pyramid like this:\n    A\n   / \\\n  G   E\n / \\ / \\\nB   C   D\n\nWe are allowed to place G on top of B and C because BCG is an allowed triple.  Similarly, we can place E on top of C and D, then A on top of G and E.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: bottom = &quot;AABA&quot;, allowed = [&quot;AAA&quot;, &quot;AAB&quot;, &quot;ABA&quot;, &quot;ABB&quot;, &quot;BAC&quot;]\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nWe can&apos;t stack the pyramid to the top.\nNote that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tbottom will be a string with length in range [2, 8].\n\tallowed will have length in range [0, 200].\n\tLetters in all strings will be chosen from the set {&apos;A&apos;, &apos;B&apos;, &apos;C&apos;, &apos;D&apos;, &apos;E&apos;, &apos;F&apos;, &apos;G&apos;}.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool PyramidTransition(string bottom, IList<string> allowed) {            }}"}
