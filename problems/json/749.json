    "question": "\nA virus is spreading rapidly, and your task is to quarantine the infected area by installing walls.\n\nThe world is modeled as a 2-D array of cells, where 0 represents uninfected cells, and 1 represents cells contaminated with the virus.  A wall (and only one wall) can be installed between any two 4-directionally adjacent cells, on the shared boundary.\n\nEvery night, the virus spreads to all neighboring cells in all four directions unless blocked by a wall.\nResources are limited. Each day, you can install walls around only one region -- the affected area (continuous block of infected cells) that threatens the most uninfected cells the following night. There will never be a tie.\n\nCan you save the day? If so, what is the number of walls required? If not, and the world becomes fully infected, return the number of walls used.\n\n\nExample 1:\nInput: grid = \n[[0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: 10\nExplanation:\nThere are 2 contaminated regions.\nOn the first day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the left. The board after the virus spreads is:\n\n[[0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n [0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]]\n\nOn the second day, add 5 walls to quarantine the viral region on the right. The virus is fully contained.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: grid = \n[[1,1,1],\n [1,0,1],\n [1,1,1]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: Even though there is only one cell saved, there are 4 walls built.\nNotice that walls are only built on the shared boundary of two different cells.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: grid = \n[[1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n [1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1],\n [1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: The region on the left only builds two new walls.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\nThe number of rows and columns of grid will each be in the range [1, 50].\nEach grid[i][j] will be either 0 or 1.\nThroughout the described process, there is always a contiguous viral region that will infect strictly more uncontaminated squares in the next round.\n\n",
