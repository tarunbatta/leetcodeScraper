If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.  If there is no answer, return the empty string.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \nwords = [&quot;w&quot;,&quot;wo&quot;,&quot;wor&quot;,&quot;worl&quot;, &quot;world&quot;]\nOutput: &quot;world&quot;\nExplanation: \nThe word &quot;world&quot; can be built one character at a time by &quot;w&quot;, &quot;wo&quot;, &quot;wor&quot;, and &quot;worl&quot;.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \nwords = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;, &quot;app&quot;, &quot;appl&quot;, &quot;ap&quot;, &quot;apply&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;]\nOutput: &quot;apple&quot;\nExplanation: \nBoth &quot;apply&quot; and &quot;apple&quot; can be built from other words in the dictionary.
