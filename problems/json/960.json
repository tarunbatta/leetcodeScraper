{"number":"960","title":"Delete Columns to Make Sorted III","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted-iii","difficulty":"Hard","question":"We are given an array&#xA0;A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same length.\n\nNow, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.\n\nFor example, if we have an array A = [&quot;babca&quot;,&quot;bbazb&quot;] and deletion indices {0, 1, 4}, then the final array after deletions is [&quot;bc&quot;,&quot;az&quot;].\n\nSuppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, the final array has every element (row) in&#xA0;lexicographic order.\n\nFor clarity, A[0] is in lexicographic order (ie. A[0][0] &lt;= A[0][1] &lt;= ... &lt;= A[0][A[0].length - 1]), A[1] is in lexicographic order (ie. A[1][0] &lt;= A[1][1] &lt;= ... &lt;= A[1][A[1].length - 1]), and so on.\n\nReturn the minimum possible value of D.length.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [&quot;babca&quot;,&quot;bbazb&quot;]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: After deleting columns 0, 1, and 4, the final array is A = [&quot;bc&quot;, &quot;az&quot;].\nBoth these rows are individually in lexicographic order (ie. A[0][0] &lt;= A[0][1] and A[1][0] &lt;= A[1][1]).\nNote that A[0] &gt; A[1] - the array A isn&apos;t necessarily in lexicographic order.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [&quot;edcba&quot;]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: If we delete less than 4 columns, the only row won&apos;t be lexicographically sorted.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [&quot;ghi&quot;,&quot;def&quot;,&quot;abc&quot;]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: All rows are already lexicographically sorted.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 100\n\t1 &lt;= A[i].length &lt;= 100\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MinDeletionSize(string[] A) {            }}"}
