    "question": "A sorted list A contains 1, plus some number of primes.&#xA0; Then, for every p &lt; q in the list, we consider the fraction p/q.\n\nWhat is the K-th smallest fraction considered?&#xA0; Return your answer as an array of ints, where answer[0] = p and answer[1] = q.\n\nExamples:\nInput: A = [1, 2, 3, 5], K = 3\nOutput: [2, 5]\nExplanation:\nThe fractions to be considered in sorted order are:\n1/5, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3.\nThe third fraction is 2/5.\n\nInput: A = [1, 7], K = 1\nOutput: [1, 7]\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tA will have length between 2 and 2000.\n\tEach A[i] will be between 1 and 30000.\n\tK will be between 1 and A.length * (A.length - 1) / 2.\n",
