{"number":"955","title":"Delete Columns to Make Sorted II","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-columns-to-make-sorted-ii","difficulty":"Medium","question":"We are given an array&#xA0;A of N lowercase letter strings, all of the same length.\n\nNow, we may choose any set of deletion indices, and for each string, we delete all the characters in those indices.\n\nFor example, if we have an array A = [&quot;abcdef&quot;,&quot;uvwxyz&quot;] and deletion indices {0, 2, 3}, then the final array after deletions is [&quot;bef&quot;,&quot;vyz&quot;].\n\nSuppose we chose a set of deletion indices D such that after deletions, the final array has its elements in lexicographic order (A[0] &lt;= A[1] &lt;= A[2] ... &lt;= A[A.length - 1]).\n\nReturn the minimum possible value of D.length.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [&quot;ca&quot;,&quot;bb&quot;,&quot;ac&quot;]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nAfter deleting the first column, A = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;].\nNow A is in lexicographic order (ie. A[0] &lt;= A[1] &lt;= A[2]).\nWe require at least 1 deletion since initially A was not in lexicographic order, so the answer is 1.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [&quot;xc&quot;,&quot;yb&quot;,&quot;za&quot;]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: \nA is already in lexicographic order, so we don&apos;t need to delete anything.\nNote that the rows of A are not necessarily in lexicographic order:\nie. it is NOT necessarily true that (A[0][0] &lt;= A[0][1] &lt;= ...)\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [&quot;zyx&quot;,&quot;wvu&quot;,&quot;tsr&quot;]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nWe have to delete every column.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 100\n\t1 &lt;= A[i].length &lt;= 100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MinDeletionSize(string[] A) {            }}"}
