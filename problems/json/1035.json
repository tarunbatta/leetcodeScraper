    "question": "We write the integers of A and B&#xA0;(in the order they are given) on two separate horizontal lines.\n\nNow, we may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting two numbers A[i] and B[j]&#xA0;such that:\n\n\n\tA[i] == B[j];\n\tThe line we draw does not intersect any other connecting (non-horizontal) line.\n\n\nNote that a connecting lines cannot intersect even at the endpoints:&#xA0;each number can only belong to one connecting line.\n\nReturn the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: A = [1,4,2], B = [1,2,4]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram.\nWe cannot draw 3 uncrossed lines, because the line from A[1]=4 to B[2]=4 will intersect the line from A[2]=2 to B[1]=2.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: A = [2,5,1,2,5], B = [10,5,2,1,5,2]\nOutput: 3\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: A = [1,3,7,1,7,5], B = [1,9,2,5,1]\nOutput: 2\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 500\n\t1 &lt;= B.length &lt;= 500\n\t1 &lt;= A[i], B[i] &lt;= 2000\n\n",
