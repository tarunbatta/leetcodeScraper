    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "question": "On an infinite number line, the position of the i-th stone is given by&#xA0;stones[i].&#xA0; Call a stone an endpoint stone if it has the smallest or largest position.\n\nEach turn, you pick up an endpoint stone and move it to an unoccupied position so that it is no longer an endpoint stone.\n\nIn particular,&#xA0;if the stones are at say, stones = [1,2,5], you cannot move the endpoint stone at position 5, since moving it to any position (such as 0, or 3) will still keep that stone as an endpoint stone.\n\nThe game ends when you cannot make any more moves, ie. the stones are in consecutive positions.\n\nWhen the game ends, what is the minimum and maximum number of moves that you could have made?&#xA0; Return the answer as an length 2 array:&#xA0;answer = [minimum_moves, maximum_moves]\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [7,4,9]\nOutput: [1,2]\nExplanation: \nWe can move 4 -&gt; 8 for one move to finish the game.\nOr, we can move 9 -&gt; 5, 4 -&gt; 6 for two moves to finish the game.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [6,5,4,3,10]\nOutput: [2,3]\nWe can move 3 -&gt; 8 then 10 -&gt; 7 to finish the game.\nOr, we can move 3 -&gt; 7, 4 -&gt; 8, 5 -&gt; 9 to finish the game.\nNotice we cannot move 10 -&gt; 2 to finish the game, because that would be an illegal move.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [100,101,104,102,103]\nOutput: [0,0]\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t3 &lt;= stones.length &lt;= 10^4\n\t1 &lt;= stones[i] &lt;= 10^9\n\tstones[i] have distinct values.\n\n\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n",
