{"number":"1092","title":"Shortest Common Supersequence ","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence","difficulty":"Hard","question":"Given two strings str1 and str2,&#xA0;return the shortest string that has both str1&#xA0;and str2&#xA0;as subsequences.&#xA0;&#xA0;If multiple answers exist, you may return any of them.\n\n(A string S is a subsequence of string T if deleting some number of characters from T (possibly 0, and the characters are chosen anywhere from T) results in the string S.)\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: str1 = &quot;abac&quot;, str2 = &quot;cab&quot;\nOutput: &quot;cabac&quot;\nExplanation: \nstr1 = &quot;abac&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;cabac&quot; because we can delete the first &quot;c&quot;.\nstr2 = &quot;cab&quot; is a subsequence of &quot;cabac&quot; because we can delete the last &quot;ac&quot;.\nThe answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= str1.length, str2.length &lt;= 1000\n\tstr1 and str2 consist of lowercase English letters.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public string ShortestCommonSupersequence(string str1, string str2) {            }}"}
