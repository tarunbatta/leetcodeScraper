    "question": "Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.&#xA0; From&#xA0;left to right order, the values of those&#xA0;leaves form a leaf value sequence.\n\n\n\nFor example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is (6, 7, 4, 9, 8).\n\nTwo binary trees are considered leaf-similar&#xA0;if their leaf value sequence is the same.\n\nReturn true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tBoth of the given trees will have between 1 and 100 nodes.\n\n",
