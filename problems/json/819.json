    "question": "Given a paragraph&#xA0;and a list of banned words, return the most frequent word that is not in the list of banned words.&#xA0; It is guaranteed there is at least one word that isn&apos;t banned, and that the answer is unique.\n\nWords in the list of banned words are given in lowercase, and free of punctuation.&#xA0; Words in the paragraph are not case sensitive.&#xA0; The answer is in lowercase.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample:\n\nInput: \nparagraph = &quot;Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit.&quot;\nbanned = [&quot;hit&quot;]\nOutput: &quot;ball&quot;\nExplanation: \n&quot;hit&quot; occurs 3 times, but it is a banned word.\n&quot;ball&quot; occurs twice (and no other word does), so it is the most frequent non-banned word in the paragraph. \nNote that words in the paragraph are not case sensitive,\nthat punctuation is ignored (even if adjacent to words, such as &quot;ball,&quot;), \nand that &quot;hit&quot; isn&apos;t the answer even though it occurs more because it is banned.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote: \n\n\n\t1 &lt;= paragraph.length &lt;= 1000.\n\t0 &lt;= banned.length &lt;= 100.\n\t1 &lt;= banned[i].length &lt;= 10.\n\tThe answer is unique, and written in lowercase (even if its occurrences in paragraph&#xA0;may have&#xA0;uppercase symbols, and even if it is a proper noun.)\n\tparagraph only consists of letters, spaces, or the punctuation symbols !?&apos;,;.\n\tThere are no hyphens or hyphenated words.\n\tWords only consist of letters, never apostrophes or other punctuation symbols.\n\n",
