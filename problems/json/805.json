    "question": "In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)\n\nReturn true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.\n\nExample :\nInput: \n[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have the average of 4.5.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe length of A will be in the range&#xA0;[1, 30].\n\tA[i] will be in the range of [0, 10000].\n\n\n&#xA0;\n",
