{"number":"1046","title":"Last Stone Weight","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight","difficulty":"Easy","question":"We have a collection of rocks, each rock has a positive integer weight.\n\nEach turn, we choose the two heaviest&#xA0;rocks&#xA0;and smash them together.&#xA0; Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x &lt;= y.&#xA0; The result of this smash is:\n\n\n\tIf x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;\n\tIf x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.\n\n\nAt the end, there is at most 1 stone left.&#xA0; Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [2,7,4,1,8,1]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nWe combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,\nwe combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,\nwe combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,\nwe combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that&apos;s the value of last stone.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= stones.length &lt;= 30\n\t1 &lt;= stones[i] &lt;= 1000\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int LastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {            }}"}
