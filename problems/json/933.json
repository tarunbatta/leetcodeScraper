    "question": "Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.\n\nIt has only one method:&#xA0;ping(int t), where t represents some time in milliseconds.\n\nReturn the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.\n\nAny ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.\n\nIt is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of&#xA0;t than before.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: inputs = [&quot;RecentCounter&quot;,&quot;ping&quot;,&quot;ping&quot;,&quot;ping&quot;,&quot;ping&quot;], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]\nOutput: [null,1,2,3,3]\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tEach test case will have at most 10000 calls to ping.\n\tEach test case will call&#xA0;ping with strictly increasing values of t.\n\tEach call to ping will have 1 &lt;= t &lt;= 10^9.\n\n\n\n&#xA0;\n",
