{"number":"969","title":"Pancake Sorting","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/pancake-sorting","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given an array A, we can perform a&#xA0;pancake flip:&#xA0;We choose some positive integer&#xA0;k &lt;= A.length, then reverse the order of the first k elements of A.&#xA0; We want to perform zero or more pancake flips (doing them one after another in succession) to sort the array A.\n\nReturn the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort A.&#xA0; Any&#xA0;valid answer that sorts the array within 10 * A.length flips will be judged as correct.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [3,2,4,1]\nOutput: [4,2,4,3]\nExplanation: \nWe perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.\nStarting state: A = [3, 2, 4, 1]\nAfter 1st flip (k=4): A = [1, 4, 2, 3]\nAfter 2nd flip (k=2): A = [4, 1, 2, 3]\nAfter 3rd flip (k=4): A = [3, 2, 1, 4]\nAfter 4th flip (k=3): A = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted. \n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,2,3]\nOutput: []\nExplanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.\nNote that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 100\n\tA[i] is a permutation of [1, 2, ..., A.length]\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public IList<int> PancakeSort(int[] A) {            }}"}
