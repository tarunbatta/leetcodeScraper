{"number":"766","title":"Toeplitz Matrix","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/toeplitz-matrix","difficulty":"Easy","question":"A matrix is Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.\n\nNow given an M x N matrix, return&#xA0;True&#xA0;if and only if the matrix is Toeplitz.\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\nmatrix = [\n&#xA0; [1,2,3,4],\n&#xA0; [5,1,2,3],\n&#xA0; [9,5,1,2]\n]\nOutput: True\nExplanation:\nIn the above grid, the&#xA0;diagonals are:\n&quot;[9]&quot;, &quot;[5, 5]&quot;, &quot;[1, 1, 1]&quot;, &quot;[2, 2, 2]&quot;, &quot;[3, 3]&quot;, &quot;[4]&quot;.\nIn each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\nmatrix = [\n&#xA0; [1,2],\n&#xA0; [2,2]\n]\nOutput: False\nExplanation:\nThe diagonal &quot;[1, 2]&quot; has different elements.\n\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tmatrix will be a 2D array of integers.\n\tmatrix will have a number of rows and columns in range [1, 20].\n\tmatrix[i][j] will be integers in range [0, 99].\n\n\n\nFollow up:\n\n\n\tWhat if the matrix is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?\n\tWhat if the matrix is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the memory at once?\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public bool IsToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix) {            }}"}
