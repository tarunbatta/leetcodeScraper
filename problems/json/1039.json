    "question": "Given N, consider a convex N-sided polygon with vertices labelled A[0], A[i], ..., A[N-1]&#xA0;in clockwise order.\n\nSuppose you triangulate the polygon into N-2 triangles.&#xA0; For each triangle, the value of that triangle is the product&#xA0;of the labels of the vertices, and the total score of the triangulation is the sum of these values over all N-2 triangles in the triangulation.\n\nReturn the smallest possible total score that you can achieve with some triangulation of the polygon.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,2,3]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: The polygon is already triangulated, and the score of the only triangle is 6.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: [3,7,4,5]\nOutput: 144\nExplanation: There are two triangulations, with possible scores: 3*7*5 + 4*5*7 = 245, or 3*4*5 + 3*4*7 = 144.  The minimum score is 144.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: [1,3,1,4,1,5]\nOutput: 13\nExplanation: The minimum score triangulation has score 1*1*3 + 1*1*4 + 1*1*5 + 1*1*1 = 13.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t3 &lt;= A.length &lt;= 50\n\t1 &lt;= A[i] &lt;= 100\n\n\n\n",
