{"number":"1009","title":"Complement of Base 10 Integer","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer","difficulty":"Easy","question":"Every non-negative integer N&#xA0;has a binary representation.&#xA0; For example,&#xA0;5 can be represented as &quot;101&quot;&#xA0;in binary, 11 as &quot;1011&quot;&#xA0;in binary, and so on.&#xA0; Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any&#xA0;binary representation.\n\nThe complement&#xA0;of a binary representation&#xA0;is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.&#xA0; For example, the complement of &quot;101&quot; in binary is &quot;010&quot; in binary.\n\nFor a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it&apos;s binary representation as a&#xA0;base-10 integer.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 5\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: 5 is &quot;101&quot; in binary, with complement &quot;010&quot; in binary, which is 2 in base-10.\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 7\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: 7 is &quot;111&quot; in binary, with complement &quot;000&quot; in binary, which is 0 in base-10.\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: 10\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: 10 is &quot;1010&quot; in binary, with complement &quot;0101&quot; in binary, which is 5 in base-10.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t0 &lt;= N &lt; 10^9\n\n\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int BitwiseComplement(int N) {            }}"}
