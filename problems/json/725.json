    "question": "Given a (singly) linked list with head node root, write a function to split the linked list into k consecutive linked list &quot;parts&quot;.\n\nThe length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1.  This may lead to some parts being null.\n\nThe parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.\n\nReturn a List of ListNode&apos;s representing the linked list parts that are formed.\n\n\nExamples\n1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4, k = 5 // 5 equal parts\n[ [1], \n[2],\n[3],\n[4],\nnull ]\n\nExample 1:\nInput: \nroot = [1, 2, 3], k = 5\nOutput: [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]\nExplanation:\nThe input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not arrays.\nFor example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2, \\root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null.\nThe first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.\nThe last element output[4] is null, but it&apos;s string representation as a ListNode is [].\n\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: \nroot = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3\nOutput: [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]\nExplanation:\nThe input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.\n\n\n\nNote:\nThe length of root will be in the range [0, 1000].\nEach value of a node in the input will be an integer in the range [0, 999].\nk will be an integer in the range [1, 50].\n",
