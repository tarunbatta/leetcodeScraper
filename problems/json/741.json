    "question": "In a N x N grid representing a field of cherries, each cell is one of three possible integers.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\t0 means the cell is empty, so you can pass through;\n\t1 means the cell contains a cherry, that you can pick up and pass through;\n\t-1 means the cell contains a thorn that blocks your way.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nYour task is to collect maximum number of cherries possible by following the rules below:\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\tStarting at the position (0, 0) and reaching (N-1, N-1) by moving right or down through valid path cells (cells with value 0 or 1);\n\tAfter reaching (N-1, N-1), returning to (0, 0) by moving left or up through valid path cells;\n\tWhen passing through a path cell containing a cherry, you pick it up and the cell becomes an empty cell (0);\n\tIf there is no valid path between (0, 0) and (N-1, N-1), then no cherries can be collected.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid =\n[[0, 1, -1],\n [1, 0, -1],\n [1, 1,  1]]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: \nThe player started at (0, 0) and went down, down, right right to reach (2, 2).\n4 cherries were picked up during this single trip, and the matrix becomes [[0,1,-1],[0,0,-1],[0,0,0]].\nThen, the player went left, up, up, left to return home, picking up one more cherry.\nThe total number of cherries picked up is 5, and this is the maximum possible.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tgrid is an N by N 2D array, with 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 50.\n\tEach grid[i][j] is an integer in the set {-1, 0, 1}.\n\tIt is guaranteed that grid[0][0] and grid[N-1][N-1] are not -1.\n\t\n\t&#xA0;\n\t\n\n",
