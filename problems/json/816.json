    "question": "We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like &quot;(1, 3)&quot; or &quot;(2, 0.5)&quot;.&#xA0; Then, we removed&#xA0;all commas, decimal points, and spaces, and ended up with the string&#xA0;S.&#xA0; Return a list of strings representing&#xA0;all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been.\n\nOur original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like &quot;00&quot;, &quot;0.0&quot;, &quot;0.00&quot;, &quot;1.0&quot;, &quot;001&quot;, &quot;00.01&quot;, or any other number that can be represented with&#xA0;less digits.&#xA0; Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occuring before it, so we never started with numbers like &quot;.1&quot;.\n\nThe final answer list can be returned in any order.&#xA0; Also note that all coordinates in the final answer&#xA0;have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)\n\nExample 1:\nInput: &quot;(123)&quot;\nOutput: [&quot;(1, 23)&quot;, &quot;(12, 3)&quot;, &quot;(1.2, 3)&quot;, &quot;(1, 2.3)&quot;]\n\n\nExample 2:\nInput: &quot;(00011)&quot;\nOutput: &#xA0;[&quot;(0.001, 1)&quot;, &quot;(0, 0.011)&quot;]\nExplanation: \n0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.\n\n\nExample 3:\nInput: &quot;(0123)&quot;\nOutput: [&quot;(0, 123)&quot;, &quot;(0, 12.3)&quot;, &quot;(0, 1.23)&quot;, &quot;(0.1, 23)&quot;, &quot;(0.1, 2.3)&quot;, &quot;(0.12, 3)&quot;]\n\n\nExample 4:\nInput: &quot;(100)&quot;\nOutput: [(10, 0)]\nExplanation: \n1.0 is not allowed.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote: \n\n\n\t4 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 12.\n\tS[0] = &quot;(&quot;, S[S.length - 1] = &quot;)&quot;, and the other elements in S are digits.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n",
