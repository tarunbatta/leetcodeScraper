{"number":"826","title":"Most Profit Assigning Work","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/most-profit-assigning-work","difficulty":"Medium","question":"We have jobs: difficulty[i]&#xA0;is the difficulty of the&#xA0;ith job, and&#xA0;profit[i]&#xA0;is the profit of the&#xA0;ith job.&#xA0;\n\nNow we have some workers.&#xA0;worker[i]&#xA0;is the ability of the&#xA0;ith worker, which means that this worker can only complete a job with difficulty at most&#xA0;worker[i].&#xA0;\n\nEvery worker can be assigned at most one job, but one job&#xA0;can be completed multiple times.\n\nFor example, if 3 people attempt the same job that pays $1, then the total profit will be $3.&#xA0; If a worker cannot complete any job, his profit is $0.\n\nWhat is the most profit we can make?\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: difficulty = [2,4,6,8,10], profit = [10,20,30,40,50], worker = [4,5,6,7]\nOutput: 100 \nExplanation: Workers are assigned jobs of difficulty [4,4,6,6] and they get profit of [20,20,30,30] seperately.\n\nNotes:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= difficulty.length = profit.length &lt;= 10000\n\t1 &lt;= worker.length &lt;= 10000\n\tdifficulty[i], profit[i], worker[i]&#xA0; are in range&#xA0;[1, 10^5]\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MaxProfitAssignment(int[] difficulty, int[] profit, int[] worker) {            }}"}
