    "question": "Alex and Lee play a game with piles of stones.&#xA0; There are an even number of&#xA0;piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].\n\nThe objective of the game is to end with the most&#xA0;stones.&#xA0; The total number of stones is odd, so there are no ties.\n\nAlex and Lee take turns, with Alex starting first.&#xA0; Each turn, a player&#xA0;takes the entire pile of stones from either the beginning or the end of the row.&#xA0; This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the most stones wins.\n\nAssuming Alex and Lee play optimally, return True&#xA0;if and only if Alex wins the game.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [5,3,4,5]\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nAlex starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.\nSay he takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].\nIf Lee takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alex takes 5 to win with 10 points.\nIf Lee takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alex takes 4 to win with 9 points.\nThis demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alex, so we return true.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t2 &lt;= piles.length &lt;= 500\n\tpiles.length is even.\n\t1 &lt;= piles[i] &lt;= 500\n\tsum(piles) is odd.\n",
