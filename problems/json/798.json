{"number":"798","title":"Smallest Rotation with Highest Score","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-rotation-with-highest-score","difficulty":"Hard","question":"&#xA0;Given an array A, we may rotate it by a non-negative integer K so that the array becomes A[K], A[K+1], A{K+2], ... A[A.length - 1], A[0], A[1], ..., A[K-1].&#xA0; Afterward, any entries that are less than or equal to their index are worth 1 point.&#xA0;\n\nFor example, if we have [2, 4, 1, 3, 0], and we rotate by K = 2, it becomes [1, 3, 0, 2, 4].&#xA0; This is worth 3 points because 1 &gt; 0 [no points], 3 &gt; 1 [no points], 0 &lt;= 2 [one point], 2 &lt;= 3 [one point], 4 &lt;= 4 [one point].\n\nOver all possible rotations, return the rotation index K that corresponds to the highest score we could receive.&#xA0; If there are multiple answers, return the smallest such index K.\n\nExample 1:\nInput: [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:  \nScores for each K are listed below: \nK = 0,  A = [2,3,1,4,0],    score 2\nK = 1,  A = [3,1,4,0,2],    score 3\nK = 2,  A = [1,4,0,2,3],    score 3\nK = 3,  A = [4,0,2,3,1],    score 4\nK = 4,  A = [0,2,3,1,4],    score 3\n\n\nSo we should choose K = 3, which has the highest score.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 2:\nInput: [1, 3, 0, 2, 4]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:  A will always have 3 points no matter how it shifts.\nSo we will choose the smallest K, which is 0.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tA&#xA0;will have&#xA0;length at most 20000.\n\tA[i] will be in the range [0, A.length].\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int BestRotation(int[] A) {            }}"}
