{"number":"913","title":"Cat and Mouse","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse","difficulty":"Hard","question":"A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.\n\nThe graph is given as follows: graph[a] is a list of all nodes b such that ab is an edge of the graph.\n\nMouse starts at node 1 and goes first, Cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a Hole at node 0.\n\nDuring each player&apos;s turn, they must travel along one&#xA0;edge of the graph that meets where they are.&#xA0; For example, if the Mouse is at node 1, it must travel to any node in graph[1].\n\nAdditionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)\n\nThen, the game can end in 3 ways:\n\n\n\tIf ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.\n\tIf ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.\n\tIf ever a position is repeated (ie.&#xA0;the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and&#xA0;it is the same player&apos;s turn to move), the game is a draw.\n\n\nGiven a graph, and assuming both players play optimally, return 1&#xA0;if the game is won by Mouse, 2&#xA0;if the game is won by Cat, and 0&#xA0;if the game is a draw.\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [[2,5],[3],[0,4,5],[1,4,5],[2,3],[0,2,3]]\nOutput: 0\nExplanation:\n4---3---1\n|&#xA0; &#xA0;|\n2---5\n&#xA0;\\&#xA0;/\n&#xA0; 0\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t3 &lt;= graph.length &lt;= 50\n\tIt is guaranteed that graph[1] is non-empty.\n\tIt is guaranteed that graph[2] contains a non-zero element.&#xA0;\n\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int CatMouseGame(int[][] graph) {            }}"}
