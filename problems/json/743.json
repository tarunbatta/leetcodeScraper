{"number":"743","title":"Network Delay Time","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/network-delay-time","difficulty":"Medium","question":"There are N network nodes, labelled 1 to N.\n\nGiven times, a list of travel times as directed edges times[i] = (u, v, w), where u is the source node, v is the target node, and w is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.\n\nNow, we send a signal from a certain node K. How long will it take for all nodes to receive the signal? If it is impossible, return -1.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\nInput: times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], N = 4, K = 2\nOutput: 2\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tN will be in the range [1, 100].\n\tK will be in the range [1, N].\n\tThe length of times will be in the range [1, 6000].\n\tAll edges times[i] = (u, v, w) will have 1 &lt;= u, v &lt;= N and 0 &lt;= w &lt;= 100.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int NetworkDelayTime(int[][] times, int N, int K) {            }}"}
