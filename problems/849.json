{"number":"849","title":"Maximize Distance to Closest Person","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person","difficulty":"Easy","question":"In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty.&#xA0;\n\nThere is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.\n\nAlex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized.&#xA0;\n\nReturn that maximum distance to closest person.\n\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: \nIf Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.\nIf Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.\nThus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: [1,0,0,0]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation: \nIf Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.\nThis is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.\n\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= seats.length &lt;= 20000\n\tseats&#xA0;contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.\n\n\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int MaxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {            }}"}
