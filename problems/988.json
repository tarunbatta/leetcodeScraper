{"number":"988","title":"Smallest String Starting From Leaf","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-string-starting-from-leaf","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from 0 to 25 representing the letters &apos;a&apos; to &apos;z&apos;: a value of 0 represents &apos;a&apos;, a value of 1 represents &apos;b&apos;, and so on.\n\nFind the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.\n\n(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, &quot;ab&quot; is lexicographically smaller than &quot;aba&quot;.&#xA0; A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)\n\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1:\n\n\n\nInput: [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]\nOutput: &quot;dba&quot;\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\n\n\nInput: [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]\nOutput: &quot;adz&quot;\n\n\n\nExample 3:\n\n\n\nInput: [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]\nOutput: &quot;abc&quot;\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\tThe number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 8500.\n\tEach node in the tree will have a value between 0 and 25.\n\n\n\n","code":"undefined/** * Definition for a binary tree node. * public class TreeNode { *     public int val; *     public TreeNode left; *     public TreeNode right; *     public TreeNode(int x) { val = x; } * } */public class Solution {    public string SmallestFromLeaf(TreeNode root) {            }}"}
