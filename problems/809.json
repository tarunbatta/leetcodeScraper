{"number":"809","title":"Expressive Words","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/expressive-words","difficulty":"Medium","question":"Sometimes people repeat letters to represent extra feeling, such as &quot;hello&quot; -&gt; &quot;heeellooo&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; -&gt; &quot;hiiii&quot;.&#xA0; In these strings like &quot;heeellooo&quot;, we have groups of adjacent letters that are all the same:&#xA0; &quot;h&quot;, &quot;eee&quot;, &quot;ll&quot;, &quot;ooo&quot;.\n\nFor some given string S, a query word is stretchy if it can be made to be equal to S by any&#xA0;number of&#xA0;applications of the following extension operation: choose a group consisting of&#xA0;characters c, and add some number of characters c to the group so that the size of the group is 3 or more.\n\nFor example, starting with &quot;hello&quot;, we could do an extension on the group &quot;o&quot; to get &quot;hellooo&quot;, but we cannot get &quot;helloo&quot; since the group &quot;oo&quot; has size less than 3.&#xA0; Also, we could do another extension like &quot;ll&quot; -&gt; &quot;lllll&quot; to get &quot;helllllooo&quot;.&#xA0; If S = &quot;helllllooo&quot;, then the query word &quot;hello&quot; would be stretchy because of these two extension operations:&#xA0;query = &quot;hello&quot; -&gt; &quot;hellooo&quot; -&gt;&#xA0;&quot;helllllooo&quot; = S.\n\nGiven a list of query words, return the number of words that are stretchy.&#xA0;\n\n&#xA0;\n\nExample:\nInput: \nS = &quot;heeellooo&quot;\nwords = [&quot;hello&quot;, &quot;hi&quot;, &quot;helo&quot;]\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: \nWe can extend &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; in the word &quot;hello&quot; to get &quot;heeellooo&quot;.\nWe can&apos;t extend &quot;helo&quot; to get &quot;heeellooo&quot; because the group &quot;ll&quot; is not size 3 or more.\n\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNotes: \n\n\n\t0 &lt;= len(S) &lt;= 100.\n\t0 &lt;= len(words) &lt;= 100.\n\t0 &lt;= len(words[i]) &lt;= 100.\n\tS and all words in words&#xA0;consist only of&#xA0;lowercase letters\n\n\n&#xA0;\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int ExpressiveWords(string S, string[] words) {            }}"}
