{"number":"822","title":"Card Flipping Game","url":"https://leetcode.com/problems/card-flipping-game","difficulty":"Medium","question":"On a table are N cards, with a positive integer printed on the front and back of each card (possibly different).\n\nWe flip any number of cards, and after we choose one&#xA0;card.&#xA0;\n\nIf the number X on the back of the chosen&#xA0;card is not on the front of any card, then this number X is good.\n\nWhat is the smallest number that is good?&#xA0; If no number is good, output 0.\n\nHere, fronts[i] and backs[i] represent the number on the front and back of card i.&#xA0;\n\nA&#xA0;flip swaps the front and back numbers, so the value on the front is now on the back and vice versa.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: fronts = [1,2,4,4,7], backs = [1,3,4,1,3]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: If we flip the second card, the fronts are [1,3,4,4,7] and the backs are [1,2,4,1,3].\nWe choose the second card, which has number 2 on the back, and it isn&apos;t on the front of any card, so 2 is good.\n\n&#xA0;\n\nNote:\n\n\n\t1 &lt;= fronts.length == backs.length&#xA0;&lt;=&#xA0;1000.\n\t1 &lt;=&#xA0;fronts[i]&#xA0;&lt;= 2000.\n\t1 &lt;= backs[i]&#xA0;&lt;= 2000.\n\n","code":"undefinedpublic class Solution {    public int Flipgame(int[] fronts, int[] backs) {            }}"}
